# Liver-Disease-Classification-using-Machine-Learning
🩺 Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying whether a person has liver disease based on their medical attributes.
It is a binary classification problem using Machine Learning techniques.

🧠 Machine Learning Models Used
Logistic Regression (Manual Implementation)

Support Vector Machines (SVM) with different kernels

K-Nearest Neighbors (Manual Implementation)

Gaussian and Bernoulli Naive Bayes

XGBoost Classifier

📊 Dataset
The dataset contains patient information such as age, gender, bilirubin levels, and enzyme counts.

Target variable: Liver Disease (1 = Has Disease, 0 = No Disease)

🏆 Current Results
Multiple models trained and evaluated.

Evaluation metrics: Accuracy Score, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report.

(Note: Final model selection and improvements are still in progress.)

🚀 Future Improvements (Planned)
Add Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations.

Perform feature engineering and scaling.

Apply k-Fold Cross-Validation for better evaluation.

Tune hyperparameters (GridSearchCV/RandomizedSearchCV).

Build a Streamlit Web App for real-time predictions.
